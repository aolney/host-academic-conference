## Overview

Hosting an academic conference is a big job. It's manageable with a lot of planning and experience, but most people only do it once and start with **zero** experience and naive planning.

Hopefully this document will help. There are a lot of approaches to communicating how this works, but two seem to be the most salient/useful:

* A top-down decomposition of the **product**
* A timeline of tasks

Let's look at these in turn.

### Product

Like it or not, you are creating a product that people will buy. People want value for their money. That means you need to carefully think about the **customer** and the experience they will have. Will this be a conference that people remember fondly five years later? One that will be forgotten in a year? Or one that people will be cursing ten years later (yes that happens, don't let it happen to you)?

Because you are making a product, I recommend a top-down decomposition that is *outside-in*. Start with what people will touch/contact/experience and then consider the infrastructure/planning to support it. Here are some examples:

- **Wrong way:** We need a registration website, what can we use?
- **Right way:** When people register, they need to express meal preferences. They will also need to be able to edit their existing registrations if their plans change. What registration websites would support this functionality?

If the right way sounds a lot like requirements engineering in software development, you're not wrong.

### Timeline

It's true that there are some tasks that are dependent on others. Some tasks have an extended duration and contain a hierarchy of subtasks (e.g. setting up the conference program). However, the timeline isn't quite as tricky as you might think, so don't panic.


## The Best Example

The best example for any conference is *last year's conference*. The best place to start with that is the conference website if it is still available. I'm going to use [Artificial Intelligence in Education 2013](http://aied2013.memphis.edu/) as my running example. Let's look at the website:

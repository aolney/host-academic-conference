host-academic-conference
========================

An evolving document on how to host an academic conference

Disclaimer
------------

This document reflects my experience with hosting *only* two academic conferences. All advice is subjective. In some cases it may stem more from leadership philosophy than anything else.


How you can help
-----------------------

* Get a [GitHub account](http://github.com).
* Fork this repository
* Make changes to it as you see fit (called *commits*).
* Request changes using [*issues*](https://github.com/aolney/host-academic-conference/issues)
* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out
  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to
  branch and evolve the story in whicheer way you want.
* You can keep it (hey, it's free as in free speech) or, if you think
  it's a worthwhile addition to Hoborg, do a Pull Request.
* [Check out the TODO list](TODO.md) in case you find something that
  you could do yourself. 


---------------------------------------

Just go to [the novel](text/text.md). You can also [read about the characters](text/characters.md), although doing so might result in spoilerage, or about the [geography of the Republic of Florida](text/geography.md).

How this can help
-----------------------

Read the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) to get your very own novel going in Github. 

Navigating the repository
---------------------------------

You already know the [text](text/README.md) directory, which contains
the novel text itself as well as scraps we might need for
later. [resources](resources/README.md) contains HTML templates,
images and other non-text stuff. [apps](apps/README.md) includes
conversion scripts and other mainly Perl scripts I use for managing
this. [Text-Hoborg](Text-Hoborg/README) contains a Perl module that is
used for testing and continuous integration and might eventually
contain the novel itself and be released that way. 

Get in touch
---------------

If it is some issue related to the novel, [use the GitHub
issues](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues), any other business, just
[email me](mailto:hoborg@merelo.net).
